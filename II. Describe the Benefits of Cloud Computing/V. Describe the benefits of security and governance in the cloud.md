# Describe the Benefits of Security and Governance in the Cloud

**Completed:** 100 XP  
**Duration:** 2 minutes

Whether you’re deploying infrastructure as a service (IaaS) or software as a service (SaaS), cloud features support governance and compliance. Templates help ensure that all your deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements. Additionally, you can update all your deployed resources to new standards as standards change. Cloud-based auditing helps flag any resource that’s out of compliance with your corporate standards and provides mitigation strategies. Depending on your operating model, software patches and updates may also automatically be applied, which helps with both governance and security.

## Security

On the security side, you can find a cloud solution that matches your security needs. If you want maximum control of security, infrastructure as a service provides you with physical resources but lets you manage the operating systems and installed software, including patches and maintenance. If you want patches and maintenance taken care of automatically, platform as a service (PaaS) or software as a service deployments may be the best cloud strategies for you.

Because the cloud is intended as an over-the-internet delivery of IT resources, cloud providers are typically well-suited to handle things like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, making your network more robust and secure.

## Governance

By establishing a good governance footprint early, you can keep your cloud footprint updated, secure, and well managed.
