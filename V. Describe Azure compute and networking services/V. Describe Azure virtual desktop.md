# Describe Azure Virtual Desktop

Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud. It enables you to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location. Azure Virtual Desktop works across devices and operating systems, and works with apps that you can use to access remote desktops or most modern browsers.

## Enhance Security

- Provides centralized security management for users' desktops with Microsoft Entra ID.
- Enables multifactor authentication to secure user sign-ins.
- Secures access to data by assigning granular role-based access controls (RBACs) to users.
- Data and apps are separated from local hardware, reducing the risk of confidential data being left on personal devices.
- User sessions are isolated in both single and multi-session environments.

## Multi-session Windows 10 or Windows 11 Deployment

- Allows the use of Windows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session, the only Windows client-based operating system that enables multiple concurrent users on a single VM.
- Provides a more consistent experience with broader application support compared to Windows Server-based operating systems.
