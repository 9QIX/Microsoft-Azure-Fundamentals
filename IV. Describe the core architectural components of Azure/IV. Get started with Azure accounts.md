# Get started with Azure accounts

**Completed:** 100 XP  
**Duration:** 4 minutes

To create and use Azure services, you need an Azure subscription. When completing Learn modules, a temporary subscription is often created for you, running in an environment called the Learn sandbox. However, for your own applications and business needs, you must create an Azure account, and a subscription will be generated for you. Once you have an Azure account, you can create additional subscriptions as needed, such as for different departments within your organization.

## Creating an Azure account

If you're new to Azure, you can sign up for a free account on the Azure website, allowing you to start exploring at no cost. When ready, you can choose to upgrade your free account or create a new subscription to pay for additional Azure services beyond the free account limits.

### Azure free account

The Azure free account includes:

- Free access to popular Azure products for 12 months.
- A credit to use for the first 30 days.
- Access to more than 25 products that are always free.

To sign up for the Azure free account, you need a phone number, a credit card, and a Microsoft or GitHub account. The credit card information is for identity verification only, and you won't be charged until you upgrade to a paid subscription.

### Azure free student account

The Azure free student account offer includes:

- Free access to certain Azure services for 12 months.
- A credit to use in the first 12 months.
- Free access to certain software developer tools.

This offer is available for students, providing $100 credit and free developer tools, and you can sign up without a credit card.

### Microsoft Learn sandbox

Many Learn exercises use a temporary subscription called the sandbox, allowing you to create Azure resources during a Learn module. Learn automatically cleans up the temporary resources after completing the module.

While you're welcome to use your personal subscription for exercises, the sandbox is preferred as it allows you to create and test Azure resources at no cost.
